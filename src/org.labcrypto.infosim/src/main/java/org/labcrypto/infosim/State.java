 *       Defines the state of an entity. The entity can be any particle, system
 *       or simply a bit. At this very high level of abstraction, state can be
 *       considered very general. It can be classic or it can be a quantum .
 *       States can have many representations. This is the part where
 *       mathematical definitions come to play. Matrix calculation is a very
 *       common representation for the States.
